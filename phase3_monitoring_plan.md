📊 MONITORING CHECKLIST:
========================

DAILY CHECKS (5 minutes):
-------------------------
□ SSH to AWS: ssh -i cryptobot-key.pem ubuntu@3.135.216.32
□ Bot status: ps aux | grep bot.py
□ Recent activity: tail -20 bot_output.log
□ Space usage: df -h / (should stay ~30-35%)
□ Memory usage: free -h

WEEKLY ANALYSIS:
---------------
□ Run full diagnostics: bash check_tensorflow_status.sh
□ LSTM performance: python test_lstm_setup.py
□ Trading performance: check bot_log.txt for PnL
□ System health: uptime and resource usage
