## üí° **Recommendations:**

### Immediate Actions:

3. **Review Configuration** - Confidence thresholds may be too conservative

2. **Configuration Sync** - Ensure all bots use same/compatible settings  
3. **Market Sensitivity** - Your manual trading success suggests bots may need tuning

### Optimization:
