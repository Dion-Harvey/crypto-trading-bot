## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Key Functions Added:

1. **`place_immediate_stop_limit_order()`**
   - Creates stop-limit orders immediately after BUY execution
   - Calculates stop price at -0.125% from entry
   - Integrates with state management for tracking

2. **`update_trailing_stop_limit_order()`**
   - Monitors price increases and adjusts stop-limit orders upward
   - Implements minimum profit guarantee (0.3%)
   - Prevents unnecessary order updates (0.05% minimum improvement)

3. **Enhanced `check_risk_management()`**
   - Continuously monitors positions for trailing stop updates
   - Integrates both immediate and trailing stop logic
   - Maintains state persistence across bot restarts

### State Management:
- `trailing_stop_highest_price`: Tracks peak prices for each position
- `last_trailing_stop_price`: Prevents redundant order updates
- `trailing_stop_profit_locked`: Records locked-in profit amounts
