echo ðŸ”§ AWS VOLUME MODIFICATION ALTERNATIVES
echo =========================================

echo ðŸ“‹ If "Modify Volume" is grayed out, try these:
echo.
echo OPTION 1: CHANGE INSTANCE TYPE (RECOMMENDED)
echo 1. Stop instance in AWS console
echo 2. Change from t2.micro to t3.micro (still FREE)
echo 3. Start instance
echo 4. Try volume modification again
echo.
echo OPTION 2: WAIT FOR CURRENT OPERATION
echo 1. Check if volume state shows "modifying"
echo 2. Wait up to 6 hours for completion
echo 3. Then try modification
echo.
echo OPTION 3: USE ALTERNATIVE SPACE MANAGEMENT
echo 1. Clean more temporary files
echo 2. Use compressed storage
echo 3. Develop locally, deploy optimized versions
echo.
echo OPTION 4: CREATE ADDITIONAL VOLUME
echo 1. Create new 10GB volume
echo 2. Attach as /dev/xvdf
echo 3. Mount for Phase 3 data storage
echo.
