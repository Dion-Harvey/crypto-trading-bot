### 3. ❌ Native Trailing Stops: Integration function missing
**FIXED**: Complete integration functions added
- `place_enhanced_order_with_native_trailing` function working
- 0.5% trailing stop configuration implemented
- Binance native trailing stop orders properly configured
- Fallback to manual trailing if needed
